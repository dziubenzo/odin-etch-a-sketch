# Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch

This project is my rendition of the Etch-a-Sketch mechanical drawing toy. Hover the cursor over the canvas to paint it!

## Features
* Three painting modes: Black, RGB (random colour) and Darkening (each interaction darkens the square until you reach pitch blackness)
* Toggle chequered-paper mode on and off
* Clear Canvas button, which does exactly what it says
* Supported grid sizes: 1x1 to 100x100
* Rounded corner squares
* Easily scalable canvas width and height if needed

## How to Use
* Choose one of the three painting modes (Black, RGB or Darkening)
* Hover the cursor over the canvas to start painting
* Enter a number in the range of 1 to 100 and click the Set Grid Size button to change the grid size (default: 16x16)
* Click the Clear Canvas button to start afresh
